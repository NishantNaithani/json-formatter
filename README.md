# JSON Formatter

This application helps in formatting the stringified JSON to a normal JSON.

## Prerequisite

You need to have NodeJS install on your local machine.

I strongly recommend to use a node version manager to do the installation like: `https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation-and-update`

Then just install the version you want to use: `nvm install 12.18.3`

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/NishantNaithani/pg-json-formatter.git
cd pg-json-formatter/
npm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start or yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
